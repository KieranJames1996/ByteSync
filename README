ByteSync! 

The idea here is to create a system similar to OneDrive or Dropbox which have the feature to share files across your machines, however,I wish to make this a more client sided operation. For instance, You have a Desktop and a Laptop, when you have finished writing your Document on the Desktop you save it and close it. Then when you open up you laptop it is automatically downloaded to the laptop/ or updated.This is going to be written in Python with some possilbe server-side Javascript with SQL for users login's. Furthermore, the system will work on Linux, Windows and Mac.
V0.1 Release 
-To have this system working, but the two machines must be on constantly in order to send these files between eachother. 

V0.2 Release
-The option to use our Cloud Storage system, this would allow users to download files even if the one system is offline. 1GB(Per User) 

V1.0 Release
- Implement a file compression system which is automated to shrink the storage space of files on the server. Hopefully upgrading to 2GB(Per User) 
- SSL for file transmissions 
- Encrypted files on the server, the only person with the key will be you! 

**Please remember this is going to take some time to develop. I'm a relativly new Programmer and this is a solo project. 

Kind regards,
